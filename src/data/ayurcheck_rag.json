Solutions - Unless otherwise specified in the individual monograph, all solutions are prepared with purified water. Solubility - When stating the solubilities of Chemical substances the term “Soluble” is necessarily sometimes used in a general sense irrespective of concomitant chemical changes. Statements of solubilities, which are expressed as a precise relation of weights of dissolved substance of volume of solvent, at a stated temperature, are intended to apply at that temperature. Statements of approximate solubilities for which no figures are given, are intended to apply at ordinary room temperature. When the expression “parts” is used in defining the solubility of a substance, it is to be understood to mean that 1 gramme of a solid or 1 millilitre of a liquid is soluble in that number of millilitres of the solvent represented by the stated number of parts. When the exact solubility of pharmacopoeial substance is not known, a descriptive term is used to indicate its solubility. The following table indicates the meaning of such terms: -",

Per cent v/v (percentage volume in volume) expresses the number of millilitres of active substance in 100 millilitres of product. Per cent v/w (percentage volume in weight) expresses the number of millilitres of active substance in 100 grammes of product. Percentage of alcohol - All statements of percentage of alcohol $( C _ { 2 } \\mathsf { H } _ { 5 } 0 \\mathsf { H } )$ refer to percentage by volume at $1 5. 5 6 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$. Temperature - Unless otherwise specified all temperatures refer to centigrade (celsius), thermometric scale. Solutions - Unless otherwise specified in the individual monograph, all solutions are prepared with purified water. Solubility - When stating the solubilities of Chemical substances the term “Soluble” is necessarily sometimes used in a general sense irrespective of concomitant chemical changes. Statements of solubilities, which are expressed as a precise relation of weights of dissolved substance of volume of solvent, at a stated temperature, are intended to apply at that temperature. Statements of approximate solubilities for which no figures are given, are intended to apply at ordinary room temperature. When the expression “parts” is used in defining the solubility of a substance, it is to be understood to mean that 1 gramme of a solid or 1 millilitre of a liquid is soluble in that number of millilitres of the solvent represented by the stated number of parts. When the exact solubility of pharmacopoeial substance is not known, a descriptive term is used to indicate its solubility. The following table indicates the meaning of such terms: -",

Vegetable drugs used as such or in formulations, should be duly identified and authenticated and be free from insects, pests, fungi, micro-organisms, pesticides, and other animal matter including animal excreta, be within the permitted and specified limits for lead, arsenic and heavy metals, and show no abnormal odour, colour, sliminess, mould or other evidence of deterioration. The quantitative tests e. g. total ash, acid-insoluble ash, water-soluble ash, alcohol-soluble extractive, water- soluble extractive, ether-soluble extractive, moisture content, volatile oil content and assays are the methods upon which the standards of Pharmacopoeia depend. The methods for assays are described in their respective monographs and for other quantitative tests, methods are not repeated in the text of monographs but only the corresponding reference of appropriate appendix is given. The analyst is not precluded from employing an alternate method in any instance if he is satisfied that the method, which he uses, will give the same result as the Pharmacopoeial Method. In suitable instances the methods of microanalysis, if of equivalent accuracy, may be substituted for the tests and assays described. However, in the event of doubt or dispute the methods of analysis of the Pharmacopoeia are alone authoritative. The following table indicates the meaning of such terms: -",

Vegetable drugs used as such or in formulations, should be duly identified and authenticated and be free from insects, pests, fungi, micro-organisms, pesticides, and other animal matter including animal excreta, be within the permitted and specified limits for lead, arsenic and heavy metals, and show no abnormal odour, colour, sliminess, mould or other evidence of deterioration. The quantitative tests e. g. total ash, acid-insoluble ash, water-soluble ash, alcohol-soluble extractive, water- soluble extractive, ether-soluble extractive, moisture content, volatile oil content and assays are the methods upon which the standards of Pharmacopoeia depend. The methods for assays are described in their respective monographs and for other quantitative tests, methods are not repeated in the text of monographs but only the corresponding reference of appropriate appendix is given. The analyst is not precluded from employing an alternate method in any instance if he is satisfied that the method, which he uses, will give the same result as the Pharmacopoeial Method. In suitable instances the methods of microanalysis, if of equivalent accuracy, may be substituted for the tests and assays described. However, in the event of doubt or dispute the methods of analysis of the Pharmacopoeia are alone authoritative. The following table indicates the meaning of such terms: -",
