These names have been arranged in \nEnglish alphabetical order. The Latin name (taxonomical nomenclature) of each drug as \nfound  in  authentic  scientific  literature  has  been  provided  in  the  monograph  in  the \nintroductory paragraph. The official name will be the main title  of the drug and its \nscientific name will also be considered as legal name.\nIntroductory Para - Each monograph begins with an introductory paragraph indicating \nthe part, scientific name of the drug in Latin with short description about its habit, \ndistribution and method of collection, if any.\nSynonyms - Synonyms of each drug appearing in each monograph in Sanskrit, English, \nHindi, Urdu and other Indian regional languages have been mentioned as found in the \nclassical texts,  Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part-I and Part-II as procured from the \nexperts, scholars of Ayurveda and officials in the field from different states.\nItalics - Italic type has been used for scientific name of the drug appearing in the \nintroductory  paragraph  of  each  monograph  as  also  for  chemicals  and  reagents, \nsubstances or processes described in Appendix.\nOdour and Taste - Wherever a specific odour has been found it has been mentioned \nbut the description as ‘odourless’ or ‘no odour’ has in many cases been avoided in the \ndescription,  as  large  numbers  of  drugs  have  got  no  specific  odour.  The  “odour”  is \nexamined by directly smelling 25 g of the powdered drug contained in a package or \nfreshly powdered. If the odour is discernible the sample is rapidly transferred to an open \ncontainer and re-examined after 15 minutes. If the odour persists to be discernible, it is \ndescribed as having odour.\nThe “Taste” of a drug is examined by taking a small quantity of 85 mesh powder \nby a tip of moist glass rod and applying it on tongue previously rinsed with water. This \nmay not be done in case if poisonous drugs, indicated in monograph.\nMesh Number - Wherever the powdering of the drug has been required the sieve “Mesh \nNumber 85” has been used. This will not apply for drugs containing much oily substance. \nWeights and Measures - The metric system of weights and measures is employed. \nWeights are given in multiples or fractions of a gramme (g) or of a milligram (mg). Fluid \nmeasures are given in multiples or fractions of millilitre (ml).\nWhen the term “drop” is used, the measurement is to be made by means of a \ntube, which delivers in 20 drops 1 gram of distilled water at 15oC.\nMetric measures are required by the Pharmacopoeia to be graduated at 20oC and \nall  measurements  involved  in  the  analytical  operations  of  the  Pharmacopoeia  are \nintended, unless otherwise stated to be made at that temperature.\nIdentity, Purity and Strength - Under the heading “Identification” tests are provided \nas an aid to identification and are described in their respective monographs.\nviii",

      "text": "The term “Foreign Matter” is used to designate any matter, which does not form \npart of the drug as defined in the monograph. Vegetable drugs used as such or in \nformulations,  should  be  duly  identified  and  authenticated  and be  free  from insects, \npests,  fungi,  micro-organisms,  pesticides,  and  other  animal  matter  including  animal \nexcreta, be within the permitted and specified limits for lead, arsenic and heavy metals, \nand  show  no  abnormal  odour,  colour,  sliminess,  mould  or  other  evidence  of \ndeterioration.\nThe  quantitative  tests  e.g.  total  ash,  acid-insoluble  ash,  water-soluble  ash, \nalcohol-soluble extractive, water- soluble extractive, ether-soluble extractive, moisture \ncontent, volatile oil content and assays are the methods upon which the standards of \nPharmacopoeia  depend.  The  methods  for  assays  are  described  in  their  respective \nmonographs and for other quantitative tests, methods are not repeated in the text of \nmonographs but only the corresponding reference of appropriate appendix is given. The \nanalyst is not precluded from employing an alternate method in any instance if he is \nsatisfied  that  the  method,  which  he  uses,  will  give  the  same  result  as  the \nPharmacopoeial Method.  In  suitable  instances  the  methods  of  microanalysis,  if  of \nequivalent accuracy, may be substituted for the tests and assays described. However, in \nthe event of doubt or dispute the methods of analysis of the Pharmacopoeia are alone \nauthoritative.\nLimits for Heavy Metals – All Ayurvedic Drugs (Single/Compound formulation) must \ncomply with the limits for Heavy Metals prescribed in individual Monograph and wherever \nlimit is not given then they must comply with the limits given in WHO publication \n“Quality Control Methods for Medicinal Plants and Material”.\nStandards - For statutory purpose, statements appearing in the API, Part-I, Vol. V, \nunder Description, those of definition of the part and source plants, and Identity, Purity \nand Strength, shall constitute standards. \nThin Layer Chromatography (T.L.C.) - Under this head, wherever given, the number \nof spots and Rf values of the spots with their colour have been mentioned as a guide for \nidentification of the drug and not as Pharmacopoeial requirement. However, the analyst \nmay use any other solvent system and detecting reagent in any instance if he is satisfied \nthat the method which he uses, even by applying known reference standards, will give \nbetter result to establish the identity of any particular chemical constituent reported to \nbe present in the drug.\nQuantities to be weighed for Assays and Tests - In all description quantity of the \nsubstance to be taken for testing is indicated. The amount stated is approximate but the \nquantity actually used must be accurately weighed and must not deviate by more than \n10 per cent from the one stated.\nConstant Weight - the term “Constant Weight” when it refers to drying or ignition \nmeans that two consecutive weighings do not differ by more than 1.0 mg per g of the \nsubstance taken for the determination, the second weighing following an additional hour \nof drying on further ignition.\nConstituents - Under this head only the names of important chemical constituents, \ngroups of constituents reported in research publications have been mentioned as a guide \nand not as pharmacopoeial requirement.\nPercentage of Solutions - In defining standards, the expression per cent (%), is used, \naccording to circumstances, with one of the four meanings given below.\nPer cent w/w (percentage weight in weight) expresses the number of grammes of \nactive substance, in 100 grammes of product.        \nix",

The Latin name (taxonomical nomenclature) of each drug as \nfound  in  authentic  scientific  literature  has  been  provided  in  the  monograph  in  the \nintroductory paragraph. The official name will be the main title  of the drug and its \nscientific name will also be considered as legal name.\nIntroductory Para - Each monograph begins with an introductory paragraph indicating \nthe part, scientific name of the drug in Latin with short description about its habit, \ndistribution and method of collection, if any.\nSynonyms - Synonyms of each drug appearing in each monograph in Sanskrit, English, \nHindi, Urdu and other Indian regional languages have been mentioned as found in the \nclassical texts,  Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part-I and Part-II as procured from the \nexperts, scholars of Ayurveda and officials in the field from different states.\nItalics - Italic type has been used for scientific name of the drug appearing in the \nintroductory  paragraph  of  each  monograph  as  also  for  chemicals  and  reagents, \nsubstances or processes described in Appendix.\nOdour and Taste - Wherever a specific odour has been found it has been mentioned \nbut the description as ‘odourless’ or ‘no odour’ has in many cases been avoided in the \ndescription,  as  large  numbers  of  drugs  have  got  no  specific  odour.  The  “odour”  is \nexamined by directly smelling 25 g of the powdered drug contained in a package or \nfreshly powdered. If the odour is discernible the sample is rapidly transferred to an open \ncontainer and re-examined after 15 minutes. If the odour persists to be discernible, it is \ndescribed as having odour.\nThe “Taste” of a drug is examined by taking a small quantity of 85 mesh powder \nby a tip of moist glass rod and applying it on tongue previously rinsed with water. This \nmay not be done in case if poisonous drugs, indicated in monograph.\nMesh Number - Wherever the powdering of the drug has been required the sieve “Mesh \nNumber 85” has been used. This will not apply for drugs containing much oily substance. \nWeights and Measures - The metric system of weights and measures is employed. \nWeights are given in multiples or fractions of a gramme (g) or of a milligram (mg). Fluid \nmeasures are given in multiples or fractions of millilitre (ml).\nWhen the term “drop” is used, the measurement is to be made by means of a \ntube, which delivers in 20 drops 1 gram of distilled water at 15oC.\nMetric measures are required by the Pharmacopoeia to be graduated at 20oC and \nall  measurements  involved  in  the  analytical  operations  of  the  Pharmacopoeia  are \nintended, unless otherwise stated to be made at that temperature.\nIdentity, Purity and Strength - Under the heading “Identification” tests are provided \nas an aid to identification and are described in their respective monographs.\nviii\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nThe term “Foreign Matter” is used to designate any matter, which does not form \npart of the drug as defined in the monograph. Vegetable drugs used as such or in \nformulations,  should  be  duly  identified  and  authenticated  and be  free  from insects, \npests,  fungi,  micro-organisms,  pesticides,  and  other  animal  matter  including  animal \nexcreta, be within the permitted and specified limits for lead, arsenic and heavy metals, \nand  show  no  abnormal  odour,  colour,  sliminess,  mould  or  other  evidence  of \ndeterioration.\nThe  quantitative  tests  e.g.  total  ash,  acid-insoluble  ash,  water-soluble  ash, \nalcohol-soluble extractive, water- soluble extractive, ether-soluble extractive, moisture \ncontent, volatile oil content and assays are the methods upon which the standards of \nPharmacopoeia  depend.  The  methods  for  assays  are  described  in  their  respective \nmonographs and for other quantitative tests, methods are not repeated in the text of \nmonographs but only the corresponding reference of appropriate appendix is given. The \nanalyst is not precluded from employing an alternate method in any instance if he is \nsatisfied  that  the  method,  which  he  uses,  will  give  the  same  result  as  the \nPharmacopoeial Method.  In  suitable  instances  the  methods  of  microanalysis,  if  of \nequivalent accuracy, may be substituted for the tests and assays described. However, in \nthe event of doubt or dispute the methods of analysis of the Pharmacopoeia are alone \nauthoritative.\nLimits for Heavy Metals – All Ayurvedic Drugs (Single/Compound formulation) must \ncomply with the limits for Heavy Metals prescribed in individual Monograph and wherever \nlimit is not given then they must comply with the limits given in WHO publication \n“Quality Control Methods for Medicinal Plants and Material”.\nStandards - For statutory purpose, statements appearing in the API, Part-I, Vol. V, \nunder Description, those of definition of the part and source plants, and Identity, Purity \nand Strength, shall constitute standards. \nThin Layer Chromatography (T.L.C.) - Under this head, wherever given, the number \nof spots and Rf values of the spots with their colour have been mentioned as a guide for \nidentification of the drug and not as Pharmacopoeial requirement. However, the analyst \nmay use any other solvent system and detecting reagent in any instance if he is satisfied \nthat the method which he uses, even by applying known reference standards, will give \nbetter result to establish the identity of any particular chemical constituent reported to \nbe present in the drug.\nQuantities to be weighed for Assays and Tests - In all description quantity of the \nsubstance to be taken for testing is indicated. The amount stated is approximate but the \nquantity actually used must be accurately weighed and must not deviate by more than \n10 per cent from the one stated.\nConstant Weight - the term “Constant Weight” when it refers to drying or ignition \nmeans that two consecutive weighings do not differ by more than 1.0 mg per g of the \nsubstance taken for the determination, the second weighing following an additional hour \nof drying on further ignition.\nConstituents - Under this head only the names of important chemical constituents, \ngroups of constituents reported in research publications have been mentioned as a guide \nand not as pharmacopoeial requirement.\nPercentage of Solutions - In defining standards, the expression per cent (%), is used, \naccording to circumstances, with one of the four meanings given below.\nPer cent w/w (percentage weight in weight) expresses the number of grammes of \nactive substance, in 100 grammes of product.        \nix\n\n--- Page 10 ---\nPer cent w/v (Percentage weight in volume) expresses the number of grammes of \nactive substance in 100 millilitres of product.        \nPer cent v/v (percentage volume in volume) expresses the number of millilitres of \nactive substance in 100 millilitres of product.        \n         Per cent v/w (percentage volume in weight) expresses the number of millilitres of \nactive substance in 100 grammes of product. \nPercentage of alcohol  - All statements of percentage of alcohol (C2H5OH) refer to \npercentage by volume at 15.56 oC.        \nTemperature - Unless otherwise specified all temperatures refer to centigrade (celsius), \nthermometric scale.\nSolutions - Unless otherwise specified in the individual monograph, all solutions are \nprepared with purified water.\nReagents  and  Solutions  - The  chemicals  and  reagents  required  for  the  test  in \nPharmacopoeia are described in Appendices.\nSolubility - When stating the solubilities of Chemical substances the term “Soluble” is \nnecessarily sometimes used in a general sense irrespective of concomitant chemical \nchanges.\nStatements of solubilities, which are expressed as a precise relation of weights of \ndissolved substance of volume of solvent, at a stated temperature, are intended to apply \nat that temperature. Statements of approximate  solubilities for which no figures are \ngiven, are intended to apply at ordinary room temperature.        \nPharmacopoeial chemicals when dissolved may show slight physical impurities, \nsuch as fragment of filter papers, fibres, and dust particles, unless excluded by definite \ntests in the individual monographs.\nWhen the expression “parts” is used in defining the solubility of a substance, it is \nto be understood to mean that 1 gramme of a solid or 1 millilitre of a liquid is soluble in \nthat number of millilitres of the solvent represented by the stated number of parts.\nWhen  the  exact  solubility  of  pharmacopoeial substance  is  not  known,  a \ndescriptive term is used to indicate its solubility. \nThe following table indicates the meaning of such terms :-\nDescriptive terms\nRelative quantities of solvent \nVery soluble\nLess than 1 part\nFreely soluble\nFrom 1 to 10 parts\nSoluble\nFrom 10 to 30 parts\nSparingly soluble\nFrom 30 to 100 parts\nSlightly soluble\nFrom 100 to 1000 parts\nVery slightly soluble\nFrom 1000 to 10,000 parts\nPractically insoluble\nMore than 10,000 parts\nx\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nTherapeutic uses and important formulations – Therapeutic uses and important \nformulations  mentioned  in  this  Pharmacopoeia  are,  as  provided  in  the  recognised \nAyurvedic classics and in the Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part –I and Part-II.\nDoses – The doses mentioned in each monograph are in metric system of weights, \nwhich are the approximate conversions from classical weights mentioned in Ayurvedic \ntexts. A conversion table is appended giving classical weights of Ayurvedic System of \nMedicine  with  their  metric  equivalents.  Doses  mentioned  in  the\n Ayurvedic \nPharmacopoeia  of  India  (A.P.I.)  are  intended  merely  for  general  guidance  and \nrepresent, unless otherwise stated, the average range of quantities per dose which is \ngenerally regarded suitable by clinicians for adults only when administered orally.       \n    \nIt is to be noted that the relation between doses in metric and Ayurvedic systems set \nforth in the text is of approximate equivalence. These quantities are for convenience of \nprescriber and sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical purposes.\nThe abbreviations commonly employed are as follows:                                               \nAbbreviations of technical terms\nm.\nMetre\nl.\nLitre\nmm.\nMillimetre\ncm.\nCentimetre\nµ.\nMicron (0.001 mm)\nKg.\nKilogram\ng.\nGramme\nmg.\nMilligram\nml.\nMillilitre\nIN.\nNormal solution\n0.5 N.\nHalf-normal solution\n0.1 N.\nDecinormal solution\n1M.\nMolar solution\nFam.\nFamily\nPS.\nPrimary Standards\nTS.\nTransverse Section\nxi\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nAbbreviations used for Languages\nSansk.\nSanskrit\nAssam.\nAssamese\nBeng.\nBengali\nEng.\nEnglish\nGuj.\nGujrati\nKan.\nKannada\nKash.\nKashmiri\nMal.\nMalayalam\nMar.\nMarathi\nOri.\nOriya\nPunj.\nPunjabi\nTam.\nTamil\nTel.\nTelugu\nABBREVIATIONS FOR PARTS OF PLANTS\nCotyledon\nCotldn.\nFlower\nFl.\nFruit\nFr.\nHeart Wood\nHt.
