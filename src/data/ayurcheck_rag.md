It is expedient that enquiry be made in each case in order to ensure that the provisions of the law are being complied with. In general, the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 (subsequently amended in 1964 and 1982), the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930 and the Poisons Act, 1919 and the rules framed thereunder should be consulted.

Name of the Drugs - The name given on the top of each monograph of the drug is in Sanskrit as mentioned in the Ayurvedic classics and/or in the Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part-I and Part-II will be considered official. These names have been arranged in English alphabetical order. The Latin name (taxonomical nomenclature) of each drug as found in authentic scientific literature has been provided in the monograph in the introductory paragraph. The official name will be the main title of the drug and its scientific name will also be considered as legal name. Introductory Para - Each monograph begins with an introductory paragraph indicating the part, scientific name of the drug in Latin with short description about its habit, distribution and method of collection, if any. Synonyms - Synonyms of each drug appearing in each monograph in Sanskrit, English, Hindi, Urdu and other Indian regional languages have been mentioned as found in the classical texts, Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part-I and Part-II as procured from the experts, scholars of Ayurveda and officials in the field from different states. Italics - Italic type has been used for scientific name of the drug appearing in the introductory paragraph of each monograph as also for chemicals and reagents, substances or processes described in Appendix. Odour and Taste - Wherever a specific odour has been found it has been mentioned but the description as ‘odourless’ or ‘no odour’ has in many cases been avoided in the description, as large numbers of drugs have got no specific odour. The “odour” is examined by directly smelling $2 5 \ 9$ of the powdered drug contained in a package or freshly powdered. If the odour is discernible the sample is rapidly transferred to an open container and re-examined after 15 minutes. If the odour persists to be discernible, it is described as having odour.

<!-- ID: chunk_45_46_47_48_49, Type: text -->

The “Taste” of a drug is examined by taking a small quantity of 85 mesh powder by a tip of moist glass rod and applying it on tongue previously rinsed with water. This may not be done in case if poisonous drugs, indicated in monograph. Mesh Number - Wherever the powdering of the drug has been required the sieve “Mesh Number $8 5 ^ { \prime \prime }$ has been used. This will not apply for drugs containing much oily substance. Weights and Measures - The metric system of weights and measures is employed. Weights are given in multiples or fractions of a gramme (g) or of a milligram (mg). Fluid measures are given in multiples or fractions of millilitre $( \mathsf { m } \mathsf { l } )$. When the term “drop” is used, the measurement is to be made by means of a tube, which delivers in 20 drops 1 gram of distilled water at $1 5 \%$. Metric measures are required by the Pharmacopoeia to be graduated at ${ } ^ { 2 0 \% }$ and all measurements involved in the analytical operations of the Pharmacopoeia are intended, unless otherwise stated to be made at that temperature.

The term “Foreign Matter” is used to designate any matter, which does not form part of the drug as defined in the monograph. Vegetable drugs used as such or in formulations, should be duly identified and authenticated and be free from insects, pests, fungi, micro-organisms, pesticides, and other animal matter including animal excreta, be within the permitted and specified limits for lead, arsenic and heavy metals, and show no abnormal odour, colour, sliminess, mould or other evidence of deterioration. Limits for Heavy Metals – All Ayurvedic Drugs (Single/Compound formulation) must comply with the limits for Heavy Metals prescribed in individual Monograph and wherever limit is not given then they must comply with the limits given in WHO publication “Quality Control Methods for Medicinal Plants and Material”. Standards - For statutory purpose, statements appearing in the API, Part-I, Vol. V, under Description, those of definition of the part and source plants, and Identity, Purity and Strength, shall constitute standards. Thin Layer Chromatography (T. L. C. ) - Under this head, wherever given, the number of spots and Rf values of the spots with their colour have been mentioned as a guide for identification of the drug and not as Pharmacopoeial requirement. However, the analyst may use any other solvent system and detecting reagent in any instance if he is satisfied that the method which he uses, even by applying known reference standards, will give better result to establish the identity of any particular chemical constituent reported to be present in the drug. Quantities to be weighed for Assays and Tests - In all description quantity of the substance to be taken for testing is indicated. The amount stated is approximate but the quantity actually used must be accurately weighed and must not deviate by more than 10 per cent from the one stated.

<!-- ID: chunk_56_58_59_60_61, Type: text -->

Constant Weight - the term “Constant Weight” when it refers to drying or ignition means that two consecutive weighings do not differ by more than $1. 0 \ \mathsf { m g }$ per g of the substance taken for the determination, the second weighing following an additional hour of drying on further ignition. Constituents - Under this head only the names of important chemical constituents, groups of constituents reported in research publications have been mentioned as a guide and not as pharmacopoeial requirement. Percentage of Solutions - In defining standards, the expression per cent $( \% )$, is used, according to circumstances, with one of the four meanings given below. Per cent w/w (percentage weight in weight) expresses the number of grammes of active substance, in 100 grammes of product.

<!-- ID: chunk_62_63_64_65, Type: text -->


## Page 10

Per cent w/v (Percentage weight in volume) expresses the number of grammes of active substance in 100 millilitres of product. Per cent v/v (percentage volume in volume) expresses the number of millilitres of active substance in 100 millilitres of product. Per cent v/w (percentage volume in weight) expresses the number of millilitres of active substance in 100 grammes of product. Percentage of alcohol - All statements of percentage of alcohol $( C _ { 2 } \mathsf { H } _ { 5 } 0 \mathsf { H } )$ refer to percentage by volume at $1 5. 5 6 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$. Temperature - Unless otherwise specified all temperatures refer to centigrade (celsius), thermometric scale. Solutions - Unless otherwise specified in the individual monograph, all solutions are prepared with purified water. Solubility - When stating the solubilities of Chemical substances the term “Soluble” is necessarily sometimes used in a general sense irrespective of concomitant chemical changes. Statements of solubilities, which are expressed as a precise relation of weights of dissolved substance of volume of solvent, at a stated temperature, are intended to apply at that temperature. Statements of approximate solubilities for which no figures are given, are intended to apply at ordinary room temperature. When the expression “parts” is used in defining the solubility of a substance, it is to be understood to mean that 1 gramme of a solid or 1 millilitre of a liquid is soluble in that number of millilitres of the solvent represented by the stated number of parts. When the exact solubility of pharmacopoeial substance is not known, a descriptive term is used to indicate its solubility. The following table indicates the meaning of such terms: -

Therapeutic uses and important formulations – Therapeutic uses and important formulations mentioned in this Pharmacopoeia are, as provided in the recognised Ayurvedic classics and in the Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Part $- \mathtt { I }$ and Part-II. It is to be noted that the relation between doses in metric and Ayurvedic systems set forth in the text is of approximate equivalence. These quantities are for convenience of prescriber and sufficiently accurate for pharmaceutical purposes.

Vegetable drugs used as such or in formulations, should be duly identified and authenticated and be free from insects, pests, fungi, micro-organisms, pesticides, and other animal matter including animal excreta, be within the permitted and specified limits for lead, arsenic and heavy metals, and show no abnormal odour, colour, sliminess, mould or other evidence of deterioration. The quantitative tests e. g. total ash, acid-insoluble ash, water-soluble ash, alcohol-soluble extractive, water- soluble extractive, ether-soluble extractive, moisture content, volatile oil content and assays are the methods upon which the standards of Pharmacopoeia depend. The methods for assays are described in their respective monographs and for other quantitative tests, methods are not repeated in the text of monographs but only the corresponding reference of appropriate appendix is given. The analyst is not precluded from employing an alternate method in any instance if he is satisfied that the method, which he uses, will give the same result as the Pharmacopoeial Method. In suitable instances the methods of microanalysis, if of equivalent accuracy, may be substituted for the tests and assays described. However, in the event of doubt or dispute the methods of analysis of the Pharmacopoeia are alone authoritative. The following table indicates the meaning of such terms: -
